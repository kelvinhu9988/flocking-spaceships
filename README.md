# Spinship!

Spinship is a spaceship battle game that was written in C++ and SDL 2. The graphics were created by an excellent visual artist Kenny (www.kenney.nl). It is called Spinship because the user can quickly spin the spaceship that he/she is controlling and satellite planes are spinning around the mother aircraft.
